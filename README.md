Custom Java Interpreter & Compiler Project

Built a mini programming language toolchain in Java, implementing core compiler components from scratch: a Lexer for 
tokenizing input, a Parser for syntax analysis using context-free grammars, an Interpreter to execute code, a Semantic 
Analyzer for scoping and binding, and a Generator for output code. Applied object-oriented design, visitor patterns, and 
rigorous testing with regular expressions and data streams to create a complete, modular language processor.
